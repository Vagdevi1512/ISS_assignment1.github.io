    <p>
        Many humans own a cat. Cats are considered
        peaceful and content animals. Even though
        many people own a cat, millions enter animal
        shelters each year. How a cat is handled
        within a shelter depends on the cats heath,
        handling, and housing. Disposition depends
        on how socialized the cats are, although many
        shelters are required to determine how socialized
        and comfortable the cats are with humans before
        adoption. Shelters are very stressful for cats,
        and can result in cats behaving in uncharacteristic
        ways. Cats that are highly socialized and adoptable
        often display aggressive or fearful behaviour when
        under stress. High stress levels peak when the cats
        are confined to a small cage in a shelter or household.
        Cats in households are usually free-roaming cats;
        they experience hazardous encounters outdoors,
        which cause stress levels to peak. It is also hypothesised
        that cats within a multi-cat household are more stressed,
        because they have nowhere to hide or run when spatial
        dispersion is unavailable. When a cat is overly stressed out,
        the cat can exhibit behaviours which include, vomiting, diarrhea,
        anorexia, and fever. Cats can also recognise the voices of their
        owners, which relates back to the 10,000-year history humans have with cats.

    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <p>
        Cat behavior is a cat's behavior and responses to events
        and other stimuli. Cat behavior includes body language,
        elimination habits, aggression, play, communication, hunting,
        grooming, urine marking, and face rubbing. It varies among individuals,
        colonies, and breeds. Communication and sociability can vary greatly among individual cats.
        In a family with many cats, the interactions can change depending on
        which individuals are present and how restricted the territory and resources are.
        One or more individuals may become aggressive: fighting may occur with the attack,
        resulting in scratches and deep bite wounds.

    <h2>The eyes</h2>

    <p>
        When cats greet another cat in their vicinity, they can do a slow,
        languid, long blink to communicate affection if they trust the
        person or animal they are in contact with. One way to communicate
        love and trust to a cat is to say its name, get its attention, look
        it in the eyes and then slowly blink at it to emulate trust and love.
        They may return the gesture. In a study of 18 cats, the cat behavior
        of several half-blinks followed by a prolonged eye narrowing or eye
        closure was found to be a positive emotional response. When a familiar
        human slow-blinks towards a cat, the cat tends to approach the human
        more frequently than if the human has a neutral expression that avoids
        eye contact. This behavior may share features with the "genuine"
        human smile that involves the corners of the eyes narrowing.
